    <p>Then Listen To makes it easy to expand your graphs. If you see an artist in a graph that you want recommendations for, simply click and hold that artist's circle for a second. A new search is appended to your existing graph with 10 new recommendations!</p>
    <p>Advanced search functions add even more functionality by letting you limit the amount of results for a search, as well force different kinds of searches. Forcing a search type is useful if Then Listen To is having trouble understanding your query.</p>
