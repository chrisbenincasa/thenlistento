    <p>For general recommendations of up-and-coming artists, use the What's Hot Search feature. A What's Hot Search can be executed by clicking the "What's Hot" link on the home page and searching in the newly loaded form.</p>
    <p>In the new form, type "What's Hot", "What's Popular", "What's Trending", "What's Good", or "What's New" and press enter to start your search. Then Listen To recognized many keywords so you don't always have to remember the exact way to search!</p>
    <h4>Click an example to try it out!</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="example" href="http://www.thenlistento.com/#!/hot/"><strong>What's Hot</strong></a></li>
      <li><a class="exmaple" href="http://www.thenlistento.com/#!/hot/"><strong>What's Popular</strong></a></li>

  <h3 class="help_section_header">Location Searches</h3>
  <section class="docs_whats_hot docs_section">
    <p>But there's more! Then Listen To can tell you what's trending in different cities of the world. A location search can be performed by typing <span style="color: teal">"What's Hot near <strong><u>{city name}</u></strong>"</span>. Then Listen To supports many key words, so the same search can be performed by replacing 'hot' with 'popular', 'new', 'good', and 'trending'.</p>
    <p>If your browser <a href="http://www.browsergeolocation.com/#browser-gelocation-support">supports geolocation and tracking</a> then geolocation searches can be performed! Instead of entering a city name to search, enter 'here' or 'me'. Please refer to the paragraph below to see if your city is supported.</p>
    <p>While there are many metro areas that are supported by Then Listen To's location search, there are also many that aren't. To see which cities are supported for location search, <a href="./metros.html"><strong>view the complete list</strong></a>.</p>
