        <p>So how does ThenListenTo <em>work?</em></p>
        <p>ThenListenTo takes advantage of a some great HTML5 features and Javascript libraries to produce the graphs you see.</p>
        <p>The HTML5 Canvas element feature is used for dynamic graph drawing. The graph drawing itself is achieved by using the Javascript library <a href="http://www.arborjs.org">arbor.js</a> along with jQuery. The system makes asynchronous calls to the Last.fm and EchoNest databases to produce accurate results for artist, track, and genre recommendations.</p>
        <p>ThenListenTo uses carefully designed regular expressions to recognize English syntax. These expressions are constantly being stress-tested to ensure that the user is delivered the search experience they expect.</p>
        <p>ThenListenTo is open-source and hosted on GitHub. Check out the source <a href="https://www.github.com/chrisbenincasa/thenlistento">here</a>!
